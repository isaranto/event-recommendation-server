You can build the project with your favourite IDE or with Maven.

1) ```$ mvn compile```

2) ```$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Loader"```

At the moment this server is under heavy development.

Currently, the server accepts and validates authentication requests. For now, the only valid credentials are 
```admin@mail.com```  and ```admin``` as email and password.
